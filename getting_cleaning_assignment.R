## getting and cleaning data: assignment

# The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
  
# Here are the data for the project:
  
#   https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
# 
# You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
# 
# Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
# Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
# Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
# Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
# From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
